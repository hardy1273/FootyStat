## A tracker for your football statistics

The Application will act as a tracker to record your individual football stats and/ or register in a league and track your team and individual statistics. Anyone who plays the sport can use this app record their stats and review their performances. This project is of interest to me because I have been playing football for a long time and I would want to track my performance after each game to assess myself.
